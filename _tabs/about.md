## Lead Data Engineer

I'm a **Lead Data Engineer** with 10+ years of experience building scalable, cloud-native data systems that power analytics, product insights, and mission-critical business operations.

I specialize in **AWS-native architectures**, designing and deploying end-to-end data pipelines using **Lambda, Step Functions, Glue, Redshift, and CodeBuild**. My work focuses on **data ingestion, orchestration, and quality automation**; ensuring data flows reliably from source systems to analytics-ready layers at scale.

### What I Do

- **Design fault-tolerant ingestion pipelines** for batch and near-real-time data from APIs, databases, and event streams
- **Automate data quality frameworks** using Python and serverless orchestration, reducing errors and improving observability
- **Implement CI/CD practices** for data infrastructure, treating pipelines as code and enabling rapid, safe deployments
- **Optimize cloud costs and query performance** across data warehouses (Redshift, Athena) and ETL workflows

### My Engineering Philosophy

I believe the best data systems are **invisible to end users**, they just work. My approach emphasizes:

- **Simplicity over complexity:** Lean architectures that are easy to debug and maintain
- **Automation over manual intervention:** If it runs twice, it should be scripted
- **Observability from day one:** Pipelines should tell you when they're broken before anyone else notices

On this site, you will see a mash up of some of my personal portfolio, along with a bit about me and some of my POV on modern work life.

## My Hobbies and Interests

### 3D Printing

- I'm an enthusiastic 3D printing hobbyist, I like to tinker and mess around with different digital designs. This hobby allows me to combine my creativity with technical problem-solving, always seeking new challenges and pushing my design skills further. I particularly like [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/)
- I also used to [write for All3DP](https://all3dp.com/authors/phillipbruno/) in my spare time.

### Hiking (and walking)

- I find solace and rejuvenation in spending time outdoors. Whether it's a challenging climb to a sight seeing spot or a stroll through a city park, I appreciate the opportunity to connect with nature and enjoy its beauty firsthand. Hiking not only keeps me physically active but also clears my mind.

### Turn-Based Strategy Games

- I'm an avid player of turn-based strategy games and have been since the 90's. I'm drawn to their complex mechanics, strategic depth, and the satisfaction of outmaneuvering opponents (usually NPCs). Games like [Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(series)), [XCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOM:_Enemy_Unknown) and [Into the Breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Breach) really help provide an outlet for blowing off steam while challenging my brain. I also really enjoy the [Persona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)) series of games from Atlus.

#### Genre: Fantasy

- I find escape and adventure in the imaginative worlds of fantasy literature. Intricate storylines, compelling characters, and epic battles transport me to realms beyond reality, allowing me to explore themes of good versus evil, heroism, and the power of imagination.

#### Genre: Science Fiction

- Science fiction fuels my curiosity about the future and the possibilities that lie ahead. I'm captivated by stories that explore the implications of emerging technologies, alternate realities, and the potential impact of scientific advancements on humanity.

## A Note About this Site

My content is written by hand and then edited by AI, to correct the terrible phrasing university could never get out of my system, as made obvious by this sentence which I deliberately have not edited.

## Developer and Manager

I'm a data expert with years of experience under my belt. My main passions are developing ETL solutions, building business intelligence tools, and digging into reporting analytics to uncover insights.

I love working closely with clients - both inside and outside our company - to identify new opportunities and make them happen. When I'm not doing that, you can find me helping out my teammates, whether it's teaching them new skills or just being a sounding board for their ideas. Over the years, I've focused on streamlining processes and finding ways to automate tasks, which has saved us tons of time and money. It's been a blast, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next!

## Hobbies

- 3D Printing
    - I'm an enthusiastic 3D printing hobbyist, I like to tinker and mess around with different digital designs. This hobby allows me to combine my creativity with technical problem-solving, always seeking new challenges and pushing my design skills further. I particularly like [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/)
    - I also used to [write for All3DP](https://all3dp.com/authors/phillipbruno/) in my spare time.
- Hiking (and walking)
    - I find solace and rejuvenation in spending time outdoors. Whether it's a challenging climb to a sight seeing spot or a stroll through a city park, I appreciate the opportunity to connect with nature and enjoy its beauty firsthand. Hiking not only keeps me physically active but also clears my mind.

- Turn-Based Strategy Games
    - I'm an avid player of turn-based strategy games and have been since the 90's. I'm drawn to their complex mechanics, strategic depth, and the satisfaction of outmaneuvering opponents (usually NPCs). Games like [Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(series)), [XCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOM:_Enemy_Unknown) and [Into the Breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Breach) really help provide an outlet for blowing off steam while challenging my brain.

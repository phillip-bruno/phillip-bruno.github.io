For anyone out there reading this, nothing screams business efficiency quite like copying the same Kanban ticket across multiple platforms. That is, unless you’re a masochistic genius who’s discovered how to “enhance” the process by layering even more ticketing systems on top of the existing ones.

If you’ve ever been asked to create a task in system X, only to find you don’t have access, then request access to system X and learn you now also need access to system Y—just know you’re not alone.

At some point, one would hope companies realize that while documenting and prioritizing requests has value, there’s little to gain from forcing people to rigidly follow whatever flavor-of-the-month business method or development process is trending. Unfortunately, my inner pessimist suspects that the human behaviors enabling such management systems are hard-coded into our nature and can’t be refactored without rewriting most of the code.

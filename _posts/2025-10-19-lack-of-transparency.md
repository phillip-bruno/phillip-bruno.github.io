Continuning on the theme of projects from my previous two posts, nothing can be as supremely annoying as dealing with people who are deliberately vague at work. I totally can get not understanding a problem, or being unsure of the right approach for a given situation. What I'm less forgiving of are people who deliberately try to hide their insecurity or even worse, intentionally obfuscate a hidden agenda that you have wound yourself getting caught up in. The latter being potentially very dangerous depending on the polictics at your company or the economic situation of the industry you work in.

Normally though my approach of mildly intelligent obliviousness is enough to either let people make up their mind on their own time (in another location or meeting), or to tease out a bit more information behind the instructions or long term vision for a given project. Or perhaps I just appreciate sticking my head in the sand like an ostrich; pretending that everything is fine outside my field of vision.

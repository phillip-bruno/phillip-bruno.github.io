My last post talked a bit about my anecdotal experience of dealing with super deep code bases can make debugging super tedious. After thinking on that post for a bit, I noticed a common thread with most of those code bases are what I'd like to call 'Doom Requirements.' What I mean by that (sensationalist phrasing aside) is that quite often requirements are passed onto teams as being 100% vetted by the requesting teams to be what they need, when in reality the requesting teams haven't necessarily given the request the full thought it's deserved. Hence they can give an engineer of any discipline a false sense of security, since in many cases the actual needs of the project are quite different then the reality that was initially presented. Hence, they set up the project or work to be in a state of impending doom, since the work could never have met what was actually needed in the first place. 

I think that there really isn't a one size fits all approach to solving the problem, other then a good dosing of humility (to acknowledge we are always missing information) and a healthy serving of iteration. That however is the topic of a wider discussion, since I have lost my fair share of hair dealing with the current organizational flavour of the month.

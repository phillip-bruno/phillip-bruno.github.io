We've all been there at some point in time, you start cooking and working your way through a recipe, just to find out that you have a question that can't be answered by the instructions themselves. "Should I pre-heat the pan first at the start before cooking?", "Does this ingredient need a U.S. cup or a U.K. cup?" The point being, nothing can be more frustrating to deal with, either personally or professionally then having to stop what you are working on just to search for more information to solve a problem. 

What is worse is that many of us, myself included, are bad at assuming what other people know already. In those cooking examples, the author of the recipe possibly has a pre-set routine for prepping his cooking workspace (e.g. heating while prepping other ingredients) or that the chef cooking would be in only the U.S. or U.K. Testing those assumptions can be problematic since often they don't become obvious until you get stuck in the middle of doing something. 

I guess the best way to avoid these problems is to be as explicit as possible but, that is a double edge sword though since being too verbose is a great way to lose your intended audiences' attention (short form social media content is popular for a reason.)
